          The Celsius°Cooking™ system puts fine-tuned, technical control in
          the palm of your hand – literally. Now you have the power to change,
          define, and monitor the temperatures and timings of the food you
          cook with a new level of precision. And with the connected pan, hob,
          and probe, the enjoyably hands-on experience of working on the hob
          becomes a finely-tuned culinary adventure. Celsius°Cooking™
          equipment links directly to the companion app from Hestan Cue that
          not only allows you to set, control, and monitor temperatures and
          timings but which is also home to a large collection of
          inspirational step-by-step recipes. Not only will this inspire you
          to make something delicious, but it’s also the best way to learn how
          to use the Celsius°Cooking™ system: by getting your hands on it and
          seeing what it can really do

      <p>
        Celsius°CookingTM measures temperatures at the bottom of the connected
        pots and pans – both when frying, and when simmering delicate sauces
        that can easily catch or burn – and through a probe that can be put
        directly into the food. The pot, pan and probe can monitor
        temperatures in the equipment and the food then communicate with the
        hob. What this means is that not only can you read the temperature of
        your food with accuracy, you can also control temperatures and timings
        to make sure it’s all perfect. And if that sounds impressive, just
        wait until you taste the dishes it helps you cook!
